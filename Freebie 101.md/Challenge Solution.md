# Solution
The description clearly refers to the rules so lets refer to the rule book to see if there is any thing there.
Upon going through the rulebook you will come across a section **game rules** .
If you hover the cursor over the area you can see that the cursor indicates the presence of some text besides the heading **game rules**. The text can't be seen beacuse it is the same colour as the background so if you highlight the text and copy paste it in a seperate notepad. The text is an encoded text **VEtGMjV7RjFSU1RfQkwwMER9**.

If you put the text in a decoder website such as cyberchef you can see that it is a **base64** encoded text and it gives you the flag when you decode it.
